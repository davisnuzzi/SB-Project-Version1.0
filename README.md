# SB-Project-Version1.0

### This is a little personal project I have worked on. 

## Overview:
### - This software is a simple console application which gives users the opportunity to learn more about the Super Bowls which have occured and can even add future event information as well.
### - The simple application is in its beginning stages of development in terms of software complexity and more versions will be released with more advanced features, appearance, and coding implementation.
